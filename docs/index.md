# doc-thor

You have a repository. It has code. Somewhere in that repository, or maybe in a Google Doc,
or possibly in someone's head, there is documentation.

If you're lucky, it's accurate.
If you're really lucky, someone knows where it is.

doc-thor "try" to fixes that.

It takes your documentation sources, builds them, versions them, publishes them,
and serves them — automatically. You write the docs. Everything else is handled.

---

## What it does

- Builds documentation from your repos (MkDocs today, more builders later).
- Publishes every version to its own URL, automatically.
- Serves everything behind a single domain with subdomains per project.
- Manages versions, plugins, and build pipelines without you having to think about it.
- You can deploy without a paywall nor a SAAS, good old onpremise.

## What it doesn't do

- Write your documentation for you.
- Make bad documentation good.
- Pretend that "we'll document it later" is a viable strategy.
